**1. Accessible Passage Dimensions**
To ensure universal accessibility throughout the building, all doorways located along an accessible route must be sized to accommodate wheelchair users. The regulation requires that the clear passage width of any door must be greater than or equal to **0.80 meters** when measured at the frame. Additionally, in the door's maximum opening angle, the effective clear width—reduced by the thickness of the door leaf itself—must not fall below **0.78 meters**.

**2. Vertical Circulation Geometry**
For general use staircases (stairs shared by the public or multiple users), the geometry of the steps must be strictly controlled to prevent falls and allow for safe evacuation. The riser height for each step must be maintained between a minimum of **13 centimeters** and a maximum of **18.5 centimeters**, while the tread depth must be no less than **28 centimeters**. Furthermore, the relationship between the tread (H) and riser (C) must satisfy the safety formula: $54 \text{ cm} \le 2C + H \le 70 \text{ cm}$.

**3. Perimeter Protection Height**
To minimize the risk of accidental falls in areas with changes in elevation, protective barriers or guardrails must be installed wherever there is a drop greater than 55 centimeters. For general safety, these protective barriers must have a minimum height of **0.90 meters** if the drop is less than 6 meters. If the potential fall height exceeds 6 meters, the protective barrier must be raised to a minimum height of **1.10 meters** to ensure adequate containment.

**4. Clearance for Impact Safety**
To prevent impact injuries against fixed elements, specific vertical clearance zones must be maintained throughout the building's circulation paths. The regulations stipulate that the clear ceiling height in general circulation zones must be at least **2.20 meters**. However, in zones classified specifically as "restricted use" (such as inside private residential units or areas with limited occupancy), this requirement may be reduced to a minimum of **2.10 meters**, with doorways allowed a further reduction to **2.00 meters**.

**5. Natural Lighting Requirements**
All habitable spaces, including shared living areas and bedrooms, must be designed to maximize energy efficiency and hygiene through direct access to the exterior. The code mandates that every such room must feature openings for natural lighting and ventilation where the total area of the opening is no less than **1/8** (or **12.5%**) of the room's useful floor area.
